# CSS Exercises

For each exercise create folders named `exercise1`, `exercise2` etc.

Add your files to each week. (see below)

```sh
# example
/2 - CSS/week 1/exercise1/index.html
/2 - CSS/week 1/exercise1/assets/css/styles.css
...

/2 - CSS/week 2/exercise1/...
/2 - CSS/week 2/exercise2/...
...
```

> :bulb: Remember: You need to `git add .` when you add files to your repo before you `git commit` and `git push`
