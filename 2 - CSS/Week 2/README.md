# CSS Week 2 Exercises

## Exercise 1

Create a modal window using CSS. Add a button to the page that triggers the modal.

>ðŸ’¡ Heads up: The button doesn't have to be functional yet as we will make it functional with JS in the coming weeks

## Exercise 2

Create a web app with a navbar using `CSS` to style it appropriately.

### Requirements

- The web app **must** have more than 1 page
  - `index.html`
  - `about.html`
  - `contact.html`
- Use a different class on the links to highlight the current page on the navbar
- the navbar must be responsive to mobile and follow a mobile-first approach
- you can use any sort of fake company name.

> :bulb: Suggestions: You could use `Acme Inc`, `Roadrunner & Co` or [generate your own](https://www.google.com/search?q=company+name+generator "Google Search")
